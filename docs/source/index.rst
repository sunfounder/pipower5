PiPower 5 is a versatile UPS solution designed for seamless integration with Raspberry Pi devices. It features robust power path management, dual lithium battery charging and discharging capabilities, and essential protections against reverse polarity, overcharging, and over-discharging.

With an output of up to 5V/5A, PiPower 5 ensures stable performance for a wide range of devices. Its HAT+ configuration guarantees compatibility with Raspberry Pi 5, while additional outputs, including a USB-A port and a 4x2P header, provide support for various single-board computers (SBCs) and microcontroller platforms, such as Arduino, Pico, and ESP32.

An onboard microcontroller efficiently manages power operations and enables real-time monitoring of key parameters via I2C communication. These parameters include input voltage, output voltage, battery voltage, battery capacity, external power connection status, charging status, and the current power source (battery or USB).

Combining advanced battery management with broad compatibility, PiPower 5 is an essential tool for tech enthusiasts and professionals looking to optimize their hardware setups.
